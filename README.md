# Realtime Digital Filter Design Application
This desktop application enables users to design custom digital filters by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane. It provides tools for visualizing the filter's frequency response and applying it to real-time signals.

## Features :

### 1) Interactive Z-Plane Plotting:
- Users can place zeros and poles on the z-plane.
- Modify the position of zeros/poles by dragging them.
- Delete individual zeros or poles by clicking on them.
- Clear all zeros, all poles, or reset the entire plot.
- Option to add complex conjugates for complex elements.

### 2) Frequency Response Visualization:
- Magnitude and phase response graphs for the designed filter.

### 3) Real-Time Filtering:
- Apply the designed filter to a lengthy signal in real-time.
- Control the speed/temporal-resolution of the filtering process via a slider.
- Input an arbitrary real-time signal via mouse movement.

### 4) Phase Correction with All-Pass Filters:
- Choose from a library of all-pass filters to correct phase.
- Visualize zero-pole combinations and phase response of all-pass filters.
- Option to add custom-built all-pass filters.
- Enable/disable added all-pass elements drop-menu.
